        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, which give the content structure.</li>
          <li>HTML is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development.</li>
          <li>HTML is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>An Element is a type of content on a webpage</li>
          <li>Text elements, Image elements, Header elements, and List elements are all element types commonly used to add content to pages.</li>
          <li>Meta-related elements, Content division elements, and Semantic elements are some common element types that are used to divide and describe a page.</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. Although, metadata is not seen by users; it contains important information about accessibilty, search engines and performance.</li>
          <li>The head element is a container for metadata.</li>
          <li>The head element conatins information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The charset element sets our character encoding</li>
          <li>The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content</li>
          <li>The viewport element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a webiste</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewpoint.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements</li>
          <li>The element that holds all the children elemts is known as the parent element, which is the body element.</li>
          <li>This "Parent/Child" language is often used by developers to explain the relationship among elements in HTML</li>
          <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and closing tag.</li>
          <li> Remember: An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag. A tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>An HTML attributes defines additional information about an element</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element</li>
          <li>The 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'h5', and 'h6' elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents</li>
          <li>Headings are larger or more prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page.</li>
          <li>Order matters! When using headings, it is important that we use heading tags in order from 'h1' to 'h6' to make the page accessible to users whon access the page using screen readers or other devices.</li>
          <li>The biggest heading, 'h1', should only appear once each page.</li>
          <li>The 'P' element represents a paragraph or block of text</li>
          <li>The 'ul', 'ol', and 'li' elements represents unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. Basically, these HTML elements represents bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
          <li>The 'img' element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. This element can contain various attributes. The 'src' attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li>The 'alt' attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
          <li>The 'br' element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content</li>
          <li>The 'a' element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The 'href' attribute points to the URL for the link</li>
          <li>The footer element appears at the bottom of the page and ususally contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation</li>
          <li>The section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
          <li>HTML uses the 'id' attribute as a way to identify elements and select them.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users</li>
          <li> CSS defines the color, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization</li>
          <li>Incline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet is three ways to style a webpage using CSS.</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use incline CSS.</li>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only</li>
          <li>Incline Style sheets are useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible because each incline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>It is possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTMLfile using 'style' element in the 'head' element.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file</li>
          <li>The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheet is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a 'link' element placed in the HTML's 'head'</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declaration, will apply</li>
          <li>The CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property are two important components of declarations</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element,and the element's borders, padding, and content. Sometimes referred to as the CSS box model</li>
          <li>Sometimes, we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. To do that, we use a special wild card symbol or '*'</li>
          <li>You can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to afeect both selectors.</li>
          <li>Two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together</li>
          <li>A 'link' element creates the connection to the external file</li>
          <li>The 'rel' attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource</li>
          <li>The 'href' attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external source. The 'href' attribute is using a relative path</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector</li>
          <li>Then the class attributes can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule</li>
          <li>The box shadow CSS property adds shawdow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas</li>
          <li>A box shadow is decribed by X and Y offsets relative to the elements, blur and spread radius,and color</li>
          <li>Asssigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as 'gray' or 'blue'</li>
          <li>We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex#</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a software on your computer that tracks changes that you make to your code</li>
          <li>Github is a cloud based service that allows developers to store, manage, and collaborate on code.</li>
          <li>Github is connected to Git</li>
          <li>Repository ("Repo"): 1. Every project on GitHub is called a repository. 2. A folder for your project that contains all of the files and their revision history</li>
          <li>The branch is a workspace where you can make changes that dont affect the live site</li>
          <li>Git commands always starts with 'git' and are used to save and track versions of your code.</li>
          <li>The checkout command: is to move the working branch to a new branch.</li>
          <li>The '-b' flag: creates a new branch</li>
          <li>It is good practice to name the branches for the feature that will be developed by them to help indicate the purpose of each branch.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>

          <li>The '-a' flag: indicates that we want to add all changes</li>
          <li>The staging area informs Git that the damages will be added in the next commit</li>
          <li>The pull command: to recieve a branch's modifications into the local environment</li>
          <li>The 'orgin' keyword indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub Repo</li>
          <li>The 'main' keyword indicates the branch</li>
          <li>It is important to always do a git pull to make sure that you have the latest version of the project on your local computer before you start to work. Otherwise, you might be working on outdated code!!!</li>
          <li>The "push' command allows you to create a new remote branch or add new changes to an existing branch</li>
